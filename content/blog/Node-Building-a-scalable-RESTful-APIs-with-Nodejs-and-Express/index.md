#### What is REST API

A REST API is an application programming interface (API) that follows the design principles of the REST architectural style.
REST is based on a set of architectural constraints that leverage existing network protocols. REST is short for representational state transfer,
and is a set of rules and guidelines about how you should build a web API.

REST principles are:

- **Stateless**: each API request should contain all the information needed to process the request since the server has no state in this regard
- **Client-server architecture**: both the server and the client are decoupled and can pivot independently; between them many layers may interfere
- **Uniform communications** :  you have to comply to standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **Resources** : everything is treated as a resource. Ex: _/user/123_ it might be a user with id _123_
- **Standard format** : resources can be represented in various formats like **JSON**, **XML** or **HTML** nad the type can be specified in header

Importance in modern web development:

- **Flexibility and Granularity** A clear separation of concerns allows multiple teams to work on different aspects of the same project concurrently can allow multiple teams working at the same time at the same project
- **Interoperability** the same resources can be consumed by a lot of clients like web-browsers, mobile apps, servers
- **Scalability** Because REST APIs are stateless, they can efficiently handle a large number of concurrent requests and easily scale up or down.

#### Node.js and Non-Blocking I/O

Node.js is an asynchronous, event-driven JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, designed specifically for building **scalable**
applications. In this context, **scalability** is closely related to the Node.js event loop and its I/O model. In Node.js, most I/O 
operations are non-blocking—operations are deferred to background processes (or "child processes"), and when these operations complete,
callbacks notify the main thread. This means the main thread remains free to handle additional requests concurrently, enabling the
application to support numerous simultaneous connections. As a result, Node.js is ideal for live-streaming, online gaming, real-time
apps, microservices, and more, while also being energy-efficient compared to managing multiple threads.

#### Express.js

Express.js provides a minimalist framework that simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs. 
Its straightforward and easy-to-understand syntax makes it accessible to developers of all skill levels.
Express.js gets packed with features like middleware architecture, powerful routing, easy to implement a variety of modules,
lightweight, flexibility (pattern wise),widely adopted, and benefits from strong community support

#### Project


In this article, we'll build an API to manage digital agents using Node.js and Express.
Through this project, you'll learn how to design a scalable RESTful API, set up endpoints, 
integrate middleware, and apply best practices for scalability.
 - **GET** */agents* : List all AI agents.
 - **POST** */agents* : Create a new AI agent.
 - **GET** */agents/:id* : Retrieve details about a specific agent.
 - **PUT** */agents/:id*  : Update an agent’s attributes (e.g., status, current task).
 - **DELETE** */agents/:id*  : Remove an agent.
 - **POST** */agents/:id/execute*  : Instruct an agent to perform a task, simulating an AI action.  


   **What you'll learn:**
- How to set up a Node.js project with Express.
- Designing RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations.
- Integrating middleware for logging, error handling, and security.
- Scalability tips to handle numerous concurrent requests.
